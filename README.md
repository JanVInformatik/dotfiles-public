# dotfiles-public
My personal dot files. 

# Some additional info:
Please change "user" in the bash folder to your own username.

# About the stuff I use:
1. BTOP:
A system monitoring CLI. You could argue it's a GUI with some additional features like themes for top.

2. Fish shell:
I find it an amazing shell for both MacOS and Arch Linux.

3. Kitty terminal emulator:
An amazing terminal! I use it instead of the boring standard MacOS one.

4. Zsh shell:
Honestly, on MacOS I much prefer the ZSH shell. Oh-my-ZSH and Oh-my-posh are my daily drivers.

5. Yabai as Window Manager and Skhd as keyboard hotkey deamon:
A viable choice on MacOS. My window management is pretty neat because of those awesome projects!

# About my Arch Linux setup:

I use Arch Linux with Hyprland as my WM. Additionally, the Hyprdots have proven to come with quite well pre-made configurations.
I only (manually) remove the animated RGB frames of the windows in the OS since I much rather prefer to get not distracted by them.

# About my Ubuntu / Mint setup

Alternatively, I made a new SSD that is able to dual-boot Ubuntu and Mint. 
That being said, they both use i3 as Window Manager, featuring Vim-like keybinds to move the windows around, resize them and etc.
